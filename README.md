# netcode.notes

for netcode things i feel like writing about

maybe some day i'll release some things for people to use (i'm especially proud of foxnet for example, as i've actually used it more reliably than udon's networking for things where udon networking struggles or makes incredibly obtuse)

this is mostly just dev note style thoughts and showcasing, could be useful for people that already have some concepts down, probably not approachable from zero
