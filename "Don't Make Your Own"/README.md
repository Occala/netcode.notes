sometimes i think people get trapped in this mindset of "why do it when someone else has done it already?"

for some things it's valid, for others not. it really depends. especially if you're considering a very generalized framework, making your own specific solution could feel much better for your use-case

when some easy avenue exists, most people will default to it. it stifles innovation to an extent, but is more accessible

people should still try to learn, understand, maybe even make their own if it's something they're truly interested in

working with pre-built systems is like a bunch of loose tacks that someone has put inside a bag.
you can move the bag around, but it's going to be difficult to rearrange those tacks without knowing what's going on in the bag
